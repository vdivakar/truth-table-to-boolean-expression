# truth-table-to-boolean-expression
This was done as a part of an assignment of the course "Logic in Computer Science" in my second year of UG studies.


CS F214  
Logic in Computer Science 
Assignment 1 - Problem C - Problem Statement : 
Design and implement a Prolog program that translates a truth table to a Boolean formula in canonical form and description of a 2-level circuit using given gates: 
Implement two versions of the same: 
The canonical form of the formula is Sum-ofProducts form and the 2-level circuit is formed out of AND gates whose inputs may be negated and whose outputs are fed as inputs to OR gates. 
The canonical form of the formula is Product-ofSums and the 2-level circuit is formed out of OR gates whose inputs may be negated and whose outputs are fed as inputs to AND gates. 

Note that a single output combinational circuit can be represented as a tree where the leaves are labeled by variables and the internal nodes are gates.
